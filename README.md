## I Like
Playing with Vim and Emacs, software craftsmanship, going to meetups,
teaching others to code at Codebar.io, learning other languages in my
spare time (Common Lisp, Clojure), playing chess, calligraphy,
typography, Kant, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein and walking my dog,
Erik. But most of all I like writing code.
