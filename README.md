# My CV

My CV is currently written in Markdown and is saved as `cv.markdown`. It is
available in two formats: a pdf generated using Gimli and GitHub-flavoured Markdown
stylesheets, and a pdf generated using Pandoc and Latex.

Both formats are stored pre-generated in the repository as `cv_ghfm.pdf` and
`cv_latex.pdf` respectively.

## Building

There are two Rake tasks to help create the pdfs
