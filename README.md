======================
I'm a web developer. I enjoy making things happen with a computer - mostly on the internet.

My Code

| [Map To The Future]                  | [Battleships]                      | [Chitter]                             |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
The final project at [Makers Academy], we worked in a team of four to create an interactive timeline and a map to help visualize historical data and the connections and confluence of events. Lots of JS, and lots of maps!| Battleships, written in Ruby, tested with Rspec and played in the command line. Recently updated with a fork to initialize a board across multiple dimensions.| A [Twitter] clone created using Sinatra with features specced in Cucumber and unit tests in Rspec. The style of the  HTML and CSS was heavily influenced by [Yo].

Why I am a Developer
--------------------
This year I decided to pursue a career in development after a lifetime of interest in computers and technology. I spent the first half of the year learning from home using online courses such as [codecademy], [Code School] and [Ruby Monk].
